Things to note:
-Filepaths are not relative(I am lazy) so you will need to change them
-I have not uploaded the actual data to github because I am not sure it is ok given the data belongs to Hudl
-I wouldnt advise calling clusterGoodness() because of the runtime.  I have been running it overnight due to this.  

Starting Instructions:
-Run the function loadFiles() first to combine the separate CSVs then call exportToCSV() on that dataframe 	to output the combined file
	-After doing this, the function loadFile() will load the combined csv from the specified filepath
